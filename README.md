# Metro-Nav-Optimizer
This is a Python-based CLI application that simulates a metro transportation network. It uses graph data structures and Dijkstra’s Algorithm to calculate the shortest path, shortest time or minimum cost between two stations. 
The idea behind the project was curiosity to practically apply the Data structres I learned in real world scenario — transportation optimization. It helped me understand graph traversal, and clean CLI design.
